# SVHN-CNN-Optimization-Achieving-High-Accuracy-with-Minimal-Parameters
## Goal is to design from scratch and optimize a CNN model for the SVHN image dataset while ensuring that your model achieves at least 85% test accuracy with the fewest number of parameters.
## In many real-world applications, achieving a certain accuracy threshold is sufficient, and the challenge is to do so with minimal computation and memory usage.
## Dataset : http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/
